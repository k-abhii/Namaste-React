When writing JSX, there are some rules to follow to prevent unnecessary console errors:

HTML attributes and CSS properties must be named using camelCase
JavaScript code must be wrapped in curly braces {} inside JSX
For every opening tag of an HTML element, there must be a corresponding closing tag
